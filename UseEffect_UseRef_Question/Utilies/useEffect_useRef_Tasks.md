# React useEffect & useRef Practice Tasks (No Theory)

## useEffect Tasks

1.  Build a counter where the document title updates with the counter value.
2.  Fetch data from an API only on component mount.
3.  Start an interval timer and clear it on unmount.
4.  Create two states and run an effect only when one specific state
    changes.
5.  Create an infinite loop using useEffect, then fix it.
6.  Sync an input field with localStorage (load on mount, save on
    change).
7.  Add a "Refetch" button that re-triggers useEffect using a dependency
    state.
8.  Show a message after 3 seconds when a button is clicked.
9.  Detect when a specific prop in a child component changes.
10. Add a window resize event listener and remove it on unmount.

## useRef Tasks

11. Auto-focus an input when the component mounts.
12. Display the previous value of a counter using useRef.
13. Track and display how many times a component has rendered.
14. Build a stopwatch using a ref to store the timer ID.
15. Store a value inside a ref and update it without causing re-renders.
16. Control a video element (play/pause) with useRef.
17. Track which button was clicked last using useRef.
18. Prevent a useEffect from running on first render using useRef.

## Mixed useEffect + useRef Tasks

19. Build a chat box that auto-scrolls on new messages unless the user
    scrolls up.
20. Create a debounced search input using useRef to manage the timer.
21. Build a dropdown that closes when clicking outside using useRef +
    useEffect.
22. Stop an animation when the browser tab becomes inactive.
23. Mock a WebSocket stored in a ref and log fake messages.
24. Auto-save a form every 2 seconds using a timer stored in useRef.
25. Detect user inactivity and show an "Idle" message after 10 seconds
    using useRef.
